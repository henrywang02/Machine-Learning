# Machine learning Assignments

## Spring 2025 implementation

In this GitLab Repository, you can find the bases of the ML course assignments as **Jupyter Notebook** files.

### Student's name or Students' names

**INSERT THE NAMES OF THE ALL GROUP MEMBERS HERE!**. So add *student's name or students' names and student email addresses at JAMK*.

```
# Enter your information here!
student_name = 'AC4933' 
student_email = "AC4933@student.jamk.fi"
```

Remember to update the same information for all assignments (1-6).

### Repository Forking

1. **Fork** the assignment repository for yourself
2. Change the repository permissions. Always create a **Private** repository, because the solutions to the assignments should not be visible to other students. If your repository is not private, the course is rejected.
3. Set the repository access rights to only yourself, your possible group work student and the course teacher (**Developer** rights) when you are starting to do the assignments.
4. Change the student's name to the forked repository before starting to do assignments.

### Group work

These assignments can be done and returned alone or in a group of two students.
This is particularly advantageous in analyzing and reflecting on the results,
which is an important part of any machine learning project.

* Grading for a group work is the same as for work done alone.
* In group work, it will be enough that you return one repository that was developed together with a teammate.

## Return of Assignments

**NOTE! Never change the basic structure of Original Jupyter Notebook Assignment files when returning assignments to the repository.**

In Jupyter Notebook file, the Python _code cells_ are run before the assignment is returned to the Repository.

In this way, the results of the Notebook's **output** cells are displayed directly when checking assignments. Check the contents of the notebook file yourself in the repository before returning.

Good Luck!
