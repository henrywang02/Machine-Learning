# Machine Learning Project

## Overview

- This project is part of my studies at JAMK University of Applied Sciences, where I am pursuing a degree in Data Analytics and Artificial Intelligence. As a third-year student, I have been exploring various aspects of machine learning, including data preprocessing, model selection, training, evaluation, and deployment.

## Objective

- The primary goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can analyze and predict outcomes based on real-world datasets. The project emphasizes the entire ML pipeline, from data acquisition to model deployment.

## Key Features

- Data Collection & Preprocessing: Cleaning and transforming raw data for analysis.

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identifying patterns, correlations, and insights from data.

- Model Training & Evaluation: Implementing machine learning algorithms to train predictive models.

- Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimizing model performance using various techniques.

- Deployment: Integrating the trained model into a user-friendly application.

## Technologies Used

- Programming Language: Python

- Libraries & Frameworks: Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/PyTorch, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

- Development Tools: Jupyter Notebook, VS Code, Git

- Dataset Sources: Public repositories (e.g., Kaggle, UCI Machine Learning Repository)

## Learning Outcomes

Through this project, I aim to:

- Enhance my skills in data preprocessing and feature engineering.

- Understand various machine learning models and their applications.

- Develop an end-to-end machine learning workflow.

- Gain experience in model deployment and integration.

## Future Enhancements

- Improve model accuracy with advanced deep learning techniques.

- Experiment with different feature selection methods.

- Deploy the model as a web application for interactive predictions.
